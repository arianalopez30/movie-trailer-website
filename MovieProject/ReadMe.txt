#This project is called Movie Project. It generates an html page that shows
#a list of movies by their movie posters. Users can then click on the movie posters
#and watch the trailer of that movie.

#Files included in the project are:
#    media.py
#    entertainment_center.py
#    fresh_tomatoes.py

#To run the program, make sure all files are in the same directory.
#Make sure IDLE is installed or whatever python program you want to use.
#Open up the entertainment_center.py and in IDLE hit Run. Voila!
